# MineSweeper JAVA CLI Game

Welcome to my MineSweeper project!

## Introduction

This is my MineSweeper project. It uses a 2 dimensional array to generate a field of empty spaces, flags for mines and the mines themselves. The user can control how many mines are created and inputs a row/column value each turn. The game is won by clearing the board without selecting a field that has a mine.

## To-Do

- Create a GUI
- Make the user able to change the size of the game grid
- Make a file that tracks wins and losses

## Languages used

- JAVA
